Welcome to my Advent of Code (AoC) solutions repository!

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event in December, featuring daily programming puzzles that are great for learning and practicing problem-solving skills in various programming languages.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year, with each year's folder containing the solutions for that specific year's challenges. Inside each folder, you will find individual files corresponding to each day's problem.

Example structure:
```
AdventOfCode/
├── 2015/
│   ├── 1.c
│   └── ...
├── 2016/
│   ├── ...
└── ...
```

## Languages Used

- C: The solutions are primarily written in C.

## How to Use

To run a specific solution, navigate to the appropriate year's folder and compile the C file using a C compiler. For example:

```bash
gcc -o day1 1.c
./day1
```

## Progress

I am working through the challenges in my own time and plan to complete all of them. The repository will be updated regularly as I solve more problems.

## Contributions
